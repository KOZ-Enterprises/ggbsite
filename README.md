# Gary Gigabytes Website

Welcome to my personal website, where I showcase my projects and academic work as I bridge the gap between engineering and computer science. This website serves as a portfolio for my work and a platform to document my journey in technology.

## About Me

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB). My passion for technology and innovation drives me to explore the exciting world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:

1. **Rover** - *in-progress*
   - **Objective**: Develop a smart RC car with semi-autonomous and ultimately autonomous features.
   - **Requirements**:
     - The rover should be controlled using a PS4 controller with extended range since Bluetooth range is fairly short.
     - The rover should be able to drive in a straight line or any other basic patterns.

2. **Drone** - *on-hold*
   - **Objective**: Develop a small-medium sized drone with swarm technology.
   - **Note**: On hold as I will be learning the foundations of good software design and hardware design with the Rover project first.

3. **Gary Gigabytes Website** - *in-progress*
   - **Objective**: Showcase my personal and academic projects! Oh, and by the way, welcome!

4. **Smart Mirror** - *completed*
   - **Objective**: Develop a smart mirror that displays useful information such as time, weather, and notifications.

## Future Enhancements

- **Blog Integration**: Plans to introduce a blog feature on the main page to document my projects, insights, and experiences in more detail.
