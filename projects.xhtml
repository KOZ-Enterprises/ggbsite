			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<p>I've been working on several projects over the years but I haven't done a good job of documenting my progress!  I aim to change that with this website and showcase some of the stuff I've been doing.  Below you can check out my latest and previous projects</p>
			
            <ul> 				
				<li>Rover - <em>in-progress</em></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Objective: Develop a smart RC car with semi-autonomous and ultimately autonomous features</li>
					<li>Requirements:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The rover should be controlled using a PS4 controller with extended range since bluetooth range is fairly short.</li>
						<li>The rover should be able to drive in a straight line or any other basic patterns</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<li>Drone - <em>On-hold</em></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Objective: Develop a small-medium sized drone with swarm technology</li>
					<li>On hold since I'll be learning the foundations of good software design and hardware design with the Rover project first</li>

				</ul>
				<li>"Smart Mirror" - <em>completed</em></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Objective: Develop a smart RC car with semi-autonomous and ultimately autonomous features</li>
